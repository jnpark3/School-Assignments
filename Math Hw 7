\begin{problem}{1.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $c$ denote some positive constant less than 3. Let $\epsilon$ be a positive constant less than $\frac{(3-c)r}{c}$, which is always positive. Let $B_1$ and $B_2$ be two balls of radius $r, r+\epsilon$ respectively, and let the distance between the centers of the two balls be $2r$. Given $\epsilon > 0$, it is clear that $B_1$ and $B_2$ are not disjoint. Thus, if the Vitali covering lemma is to be true for constant $c$, either $cB_1$ or $cB_2$ must cover $B_1 \cup B_2$. First, note that $3B_1$ cannot cover $B_2$ because $3B_1$ has a radius of $3r$, but the distance between the centers of $3B_1$ and $B_2$ is $2r$, and the distance between the center of $B_2$ and the furthest point in $B_2$ is $r+\epsilon$, which shows that at least some part of $B_2$ is not in $3B_1$. Given $cB_1 \subset 3B_1$ because $c < 3$, it follows that $cB_1$ does not cover $B_1 \cup B_2$. Next, note that $cB_2$ as a radius of less than $cr + (3-c)r = 3r$ given $B_2$ has a radius of at most $r + \frac{(3-c)r}{c}$. However, note that the distance between the centers of the two balls are $2r$ and then the distance between the center of $B_1$ and the far edge of $B_1$ is $r$. Thus, in order to contain the entire ball, the radius must be at least $3r$. This is not true for $cB_2$, and thus $cB_2$ does not cover $B_1 \cup B_2$. This counterexample shows that Vitali's covering lemma does not work for any constant less than 3.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{1.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Fix $\lambda$. For some $L^1$ function $f$, let $A$ denote the set of all points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $M(f)(x) > \lambda$. We are aware that $M(f)(x)$ is finite almost everywhere, and thus let $X'$ denote the subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $M(f)(x)$ is finite.

Note that Chebychev's inequality shows us that
$$
m\{x : f(x) > \lambda\} \leq \frac{2^n}{\lambda}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |f| \ dm.
$$
It then follows that it is sufficient to show that
$$
m\{x : M(f)(x) > \lambda\} \leq 2^n m\{x : f(x) > \lambda\}
$$
Applying the Vitali covering lemma enables us to get the upper bound
$$
m\{x : M(f)(x) > \lambda\} \leq 3^n m\{x : f(x) > \lambda\},
$$
but this can be improved upon given that Vitali's lemma involves balls fully covering other balls, while in this scenario it is only necessary to show that the disjoint set of balls covers the centers of every ball. This can be done with a disjoint set of balls $2B(x, r)$, and thus we change the above bound into the equation
$$
m\{x : M(f)(x) > \lambda\} \leq 2^n m\{x : f(x) > \lambda\}
$$
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{1.c}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of contradiction, assume that $M(f)(x)$ is non-zero at some point $x$. Let $M(f)(x) = \epsilon$. This implies the existence of a ball $B_x$ with radius $r$ such that 
$$
\frac{1}{|B_x|}\int_{B_x} |f(x)| \ dx = \epsilon.
$$
This then implies that
$$
\int_{B_x} |f(x)| \ dx = |B_x|\epsilon.
$$
Then, consider some point $y$ that is outside of $B_x$, and assume $d(x, y) = r'$. Then, a ball $B_y$ of radius $r' + r$ centered at $y$ would cover the entirety of $B_x$. This then implies that
$$
M(f)(y) \geq \frac{1}{|B_y|}\int_{B_y} |f(x)| \ dx \geq \frac{1}{|B_y|}\int_{B_x} |f(x)| \ dx = \frac{\epsilon |B_x|}{|B_y|} = \frac{\epsilon r^n}{(r'+r)^n}.
$$
Then, consider the integral
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} M(f)(y) \ dy \geq \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{\epsilon r^n}{(d(x, y)+r)^n} \ dy
$$
Consider splitting $\mathbb{R}^n$ into spherical slices, with each sphere being centered at $x$, and with each slice having a radius of $\epsilon'$. These slices partition all of $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is then possible to see that the riemann sum using this partition yields an infinite sum with an order $O(n^-{1)}$, which diverges due to the p-series. This shows that 
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} M(f)(y) \ dy \geq \infty,
$$
which means $M(f)(x)$ is integrable only if it is zero everywhere. This is only possible when $f$ is zero almost everywhere, and thus the proof is complete.
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{2}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $f$ be an increasing function. We are already aware that $f$ is absolutely continuous if and only if $f'$ exists $m$-a.e., $f' \in L^1([a, b], m)$, and $f(x) - f(a) = \int_a^x f'dm$ for all $x \in [a, b]$. 

Now, let $f$ be some absolutely continuous function. It follows that $f = f_1 - f_2$ where $f_1, f_2$ are both absolutely continuous, increasing functions. Then, it follows that there exist $f'_1, f'_2$ where $f'_1, f'_2 \in L^1([a, b], m)$, $f_1(x) - f_1(a) = \int_a^x f'_1dm$, and $f_2(x) - f_2(a) = \int_a^x f'_2dm$. Let $f' = f'_1 - f'_2$. It is easy to see that $f' \in L^1([a, b], m)$ given 
$$
\int_a^b f' \ dm = \int_a^b f'_1 \ dm - \int_a^b f'_2 \ dm < \infty.
$$
Then, note that
$$
f(x) - f(a) = (f_1(x) - f_2(x)) - (f_1(a) - f_2(a)) = \int_a^x f'_1dm - \int_a^x f'_2dm = \int_a^x f'dm
$$
This proves that if $f$ is absolutely continuous, then it adheres to the properties outlined in the question.

Now, consider a function $f$ such that $f'$ exists $m$-a.e., $f' \in L^1([a, b], m)$, and $f(x) - f(a) = \int_a^xf' \ dm$. It then follows that for any $x, y \in [a, b]$ where $x > y$, 
$$
f(x) - f(y) = f(x) - f(a) - (f(y) - f(a)) = \int_a^x f' \ dm - \int_a^y f' \ dm = \int_y^x f' \ dm.
$$
Next, let $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ...$ be a set of finite disjoint intervals such that $\bigcup_{k = 1}^n (a_k, b_k) = E$. Then, 
$$
\sum_{k = 1}^n |f(b_k) - f(a_k)| = \sum_{k = 1}^n \left| \int_{b_k}^{a_k} g \right| \leq \sum_{k = 1}^n \int_{b_k}^{a_k} |g| = \int_E |g|.
$$
Proposition 23 of Chapter 4 of Royden states that there is a $\delta > 0$ such that $\int_E|g| < \epsilon$ if $E \subset [a, b]$ is measurable and $m(E) < \delta$. This shows that $\sum_{k = 1}^n |a_k - b_k| < \delta$. Such delta exists for any $\epsilon$, and thus $f$ must be absolutely continuous by definition. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $P$ and $P'$ denote two partitions of $[a, b]$ where $P = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_k)$ and $P' = (a_1, ..., a_i, b, a_{i+1}, ..., a_k)$. Note that for any $f$,
$$
V(f, P') = \sum_{j = 2}^i |f(a_j) - f(a_{j-1})| + |f(b) - f(a_i)| + |f(a_{i+1}) - f(b)| + \sum_{j = i + 2}^k |f(a_j) - f(a_{j-1})| 
$$
$$
\geq \sum_{j = 2}^i |f(a_j) - f(a_{j-1})| + |f(i + 1) - f(a_{i})| + \sum_{j = i + 2}^k |f(a_j) - f(a_{j-1})| = V(f, P).
$$
This shows $V(f, P) \leq V(f, P')$, where $P'$ is any partition that is more refined than $P$.

Now, let $f$ be an absolutely continuous function. This implies that for any collection of disjoint sets $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), ... \subset [a, b]$ where $\sum_{i = 1}^n |a_i - b_i| < \delta$, there exists $\epsilon$ such that $\sum_{i = 1}^n |f(a_i) - f(b_i)| < \epsilon$. Construct the partition $B = (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n)$ where $b_i - b_{i - 1} = \delta/2$ except for $b_n$, where $b_n - b_{n - 1} \leq \delta/2$. Let $B'$ be another, completely arbitrary partition, and let $C = B \cup B' = (c_1, c_2, .., c_m)$. In $C$, let $B_i$ denote the indices of the points $c_i, c_{i+1}, ...$ between $b_i$ and $b_{i - 1}$ inclusive. Then,
$$
V(B', f) \leq V(C, f) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j \in B_i} |f(c_i) - f(c_{i - 1})| \leq \frac{2(b-a)}{\delta} + 1.
$$
This is true for any partition $B'$, and thus the variation must be no more than $\frac{2(b-a)}{\delta} + 1$. This proves that every absolutely continuous function has a bounded variation.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{4}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $x, y$ be two points such that $|x - y| < \epsilon$. Then,
$$
|f(x) - f(y)| = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} 2^{-n\alpha} |(cos(2^n\pi x) - cos(2^n\pi y))| \leq \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} 2^{-n\alpha} |2(x - y)| = \frac{2}{2^{\alpha} - 1} |(x - y)|.
$$
This shows that the function is holder for all $\alpha \geq 1$, as for any $x, y \in [0, 1]$, $|x - y|^{\alpha} \leq |x - y|$. In addition, the given function is not differentiable at $\alpha = 1$ because it is the weierstrass function.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{5}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $A$ denote the set of all balls $B(x, r)$ such that $-1/2 < x < 1/2$ and $|x| < r < \frac{|x| + 1}{3}$. Given $r > |x|$, it immediately follows that every ball in $A$ contains the point $0$. Thus, any disjoint subset of $A$ can only contain at most one ball. However, note that if a ball centered at $x$ is to contain every ball in $B(x, r)$ (i.e. the entire interval $(-1, 1)$), it must have a radius of at least $|x| + 1$. For any $B(x, r) \in A$, $3B(x, r)$ has a radius of less than $|x| + 1$, and thus no single ball from $A$ can cover all of $A$. This provides an example where the constant $3$ does not work.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{6}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Note that $x^csin(1/x)$ between $(0, 1)$ is a function which oscillates, with the rate of oscillation reaching arbitrarily large numbers as $x$ approaches 0. Let $a_1, a_2, ...$ and $b_1, b_2, ...$ denote the local minima and maxima of these oscillations respectively, with $a_1$ denoting the relative minima that is closest to 1 and $b_1$ denoting the relative maxima that is closest to 1. Then, the total variation can be expressed as
$$
\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} |f(a_i) - f(b_i)| + |f(b_i) - f(a_{i + 1})|.
$$
Note that when $c = 1$, this function becomes
$$
\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} |a_i + b_i| + |b_i + a_{i + 1}|.
$$
Given $a_i, b_i$ are both series which decrease at a rate of $O(n^{-1})$, this sum does not converge because of the $p$-series test. However, when $c > 1$, the above summation is able to pass the $p$-series test and it converges. For $c < 1$, it is clear that the total variation summation does not converge because it is strictly greater than the case with $c = 1$. Thus, we can see that $x^csin(1/x)$ is a function of bounded variation only when $c > 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Note that the forward direction is easy to see because if $\sup \sum_{i = 1}^n \sqrt{(t_i - t_{i - 1})^2 + (f(t_{i - 1}) - f(t_i))}$ converges, then $\sup \sum_{i = 1}^n \sqrt{(f(t_1) - f(t_i))}$ must also converge given it is strictly less. Then, it follows that $f$ is bounded in $(0, 1)$ because if it isn't, it would be easy to find $t_0, t_1$ such that $f(t_0) - f(t_1)$ becomes arbitrarily large, contradicting the fact that $\sup \sum_{i = 1}^n \sqrt{(t_i - t_{i - 1})^2 + (f(t_{i - 1}) - f(t_i))}$ converges. Thus, let $M$ denote the number such that $|f(x)| < M$ for all $x \in (0, 1)$. Then, it follows that for any $x, y \in (0, a)$,  $\sqrt{f(x) - f(y)} \leq \sqrt{2M}$. It then follows that 
$$
\sup\sum_{i = 1}^n f(t_{i - 1}) - f(t_i) \leq \sup \sqrt{2M}\sum_{i = 1}^n \sqrt{(f(t_{i - 1}) - f(t_i))}
$$
given $\sqrt{x} \geq x$ for all $0 \leq x \leq 1$. This then shows that $\sup\sum_{i = 1}^n f(t_{i - 1}) - f(t_i)$ is bounded, and thus $f$ has a bounded variation.
\end{proof}
