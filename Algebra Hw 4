\begin{problem}{1}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
For any $h \in H$ and $k \in K$, it follows that $khk^{-1} \in H$ and $hkh^{-1} \in K$, given $H, K$ are both normal subgroups. Then, 
$$(khk^{-1})h^{-1} = k(hk^{-1}h^{-1}) = k(hkh^{-1})^{-1}$$
Given $H$ is a subgroup, $(khk^{-1}), h^{-1} \in H$, and due to closure, $(khk^{-1})h^{-1}  \in H$. Similarly, given $K$ is a subgroup, $k, (hkh^{-1})^{-1} \in K$, and due to closure, $k(hkh^{-1})^{-1} \in K$. Given that the element $khk^{-1}h^{-1}$ is in both $H$ and given that $K$ and $H \cap K$ is trivial, $k(hkh^{-1})^{-1}$ must be the identity. Thus, 
$$
khk^{-1}h^{-1} = I
$$
$$
kh = hk
$$
for any $k \in K$, $h \in H$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of contradiction, assume that $S_4$ does have a normal subgroup $N$ of order 3. It immediately follows $I \in N$, and for the sake of contradiction, assume the other elements, $a, b$ are different 2-cycles. Then, the composition of these two 2-cycles must itself be a unique element that is not the identity (because if it were the identity that would imply neither $a, b$ are two cycles given they are each other's inverses). This element is clearly not in $N$, suggesting that $N$ is not closed, which shows that $N$ must not contain a 2-cycle. The only possibility for $N$ thus is that it is generated by some $3$-cycle, which must take the form $(a, b, c)$. Observe that $N(a, d)$ consists of the elements $(a, d), (a, d, b, c), (a, d, c, b)$ wheras $(a, b)N$ consists of the elements $(a, b), (a, b, c, d), (a, c, b, d)$. This shows that $(a, d)N \neq N(a, d)$, and thus $(a, d) N (a, d)^{-1} \neq N$, contradicting the fact that $N$ is normal.

Next, assume that $S_4$ does have a normal subgroup $N$ of order 8. For the sake of contradiction, assume that $N$ does not contain every $2$-cycle. If $a$ is a 2-cycle not contained in $N$, then we will show that the elements $N, aN$ create a subgroup $N'$ of order 16. First, the identity property is fulfilled given $N$ contains the identity. The inverse property is fulfilled because for any $n \in N$ its inverse must be in $N$. For any $n \in aN$, $n = an'$ where $n' \in N$. Then, given $aN = Na$ due to the fact that $N$ is normal, $n'^{-1}a \in aN$, and because $(an')n'^{-1}a = I$, we can see that an inverse exists for any $n \in N'$, $n^{-1} \in N'$. Lastly, to prove that the closure property is fulfilled, note that when $g, h \in N$, $gh \in N \subset N'$. When $g \in N, h \in aN$, it follows that $h = ah'$ for some $h' \in N$, and given $aN = Na$, there exists some $h" \in N$ such that $ah' = h"a$. Thus, $gh = gh"a$, and given $gh" \in N$ due to the closure of $N$, $gh"a \in aN \subset N'$. When $g \in aN, h \in N$, it follows that $g = ag'$ for some $g' \in N$. Thus, $gh = ag'h$, and given $g'h \in N$ due to the closure of $N$, $ag'h \in aN \subset N'$. Lastly, when $g, h \in aN$, it follows that $g = ag'$ and $h = ah'$ for some $g' \in N$. Next, given $aN = Na$, there exists $g" \in N$ such that $g'a = ag"$. Thus, $gh = ag'ah' = aag"h' = g"h'$, and given $g"h' \in N$ due to the closure of $N$, $gh \in aN \subset N'$. This concludes the proof that $N'$ is a subgroup of $S_4$ of order 16. Given $S_4$ has an order of 24, this leads to a contradiction from Lagrange's theorem. Thus, $N$ must contain every $2$-cycle in $S_4$.

We have proved that every $2$-cycle in $S_4$ must be contained in $N$. There are 6 $2$-cycles in $S_4$, and there are three products of disjoint two cycles that must also be in $N$ due to the closure property of subgroups. This shows that $N$ must contain at least 10 elements including the identity, which contradicts the fact that $|N| = 8$. Thus, there does not exist a normal subgroup of order 8 in $S_4$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of contradiction, assume $H$ is not normal. Then, there must exist $g \in G$ such that $gHg^{-1} \neq H$. It then follows that $g \neq N_G(H)$, and thus $N_G(H) \neq G$. This contradiction shows that $H$ must be normal. If $H$ is normal, then by definition $gHg^{-1} = H$ for every $g \in G$, and thus $N_G(H) = H$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
First, observe that $aHa^{-1} \subset H$ for any $a \in H$ because $H$ is closed, and thus for any $h \in H$, $aha^{-1} \in H$. Next, for any $a, g \in H$, it is clear that there exists $h$ such that $aga^{-1} = h \in H$. This then shows that for any $a, g \in H$, there exists $h \in H$ such that $g = a^{-1}ha \in H$ (note that $a^{-1} \in H$ as well). This proves that $H \subset aHa^{-1}$ for any $a \in H$. This shows that $H = aHa^{-1}$ for any $a \in H$, and thus $a \in N_G(H)$ for every $a \in H$. This shows that $H \subset N_G(H)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.c}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We are given that $H$ is a subgroup, and se have shown in the previous part that $H$ is thus a subset of $N_G(H)$. Thus, all we need to show is that for any $a \in N_G(H)$, $aHa^{-1} = H$. This is by definition true, given $N_G(H)$ only consists of elements of $g \in G$ such that $gHg^{-1} = H$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.di}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Observe that $H$ contains four elements $I, (1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 3)(2, 4), (1, 4, 3, 2)$. Obersve that if $g \in N_G(H)$, $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1}$ must be some representation of one of these four elements. We split the question in to cases where $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1}$ is equal to each of the four values of $H$. First, if $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1} = I$, that implies $g(1, 2, 3, 4) = g$, and thus $(1, 2, 3, 4) = I$. This is a contradiction, and thus $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1}$ cannot equal the identity. Next, note that if $g$ is an element such that $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1} = h$ is some form of $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ ($(1, 2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 1),$ etc.), then because $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ and by extension $h$ generates all of $H$, for any $k$, $g(1, 2, 3, 4)^kg^{-1} = (g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1})^k = h^k$. This shows that $gHg^{-1} = H$ for this particular element $g$, and thus $g \in N_G(H)$. Similarly, note that if $g$ is an element such that $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1} = h$ is some form of $(1, 4, 3, 2)$, then because $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ and any form of $(1, 4, 3, 2)$ generates all of $H$, for any $k$, $g(1, 2, 3, 4)^kg^{-1} = (g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1})^k = h^k$. This shows that $gHg^{-1} = H$ for this particular element $g$, and thus $g \in N_G(H)$. Lastly, consider the case where $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1} = h$ is some form of $(1, 3)(2, 4)$. Note that $g((1, 2, 3, 4)^k)g^{-1} = (g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1})^k = h^k$. However, no form of $(1, 3)(2, 4)$ generates $H$ given $(1, 3)(2, 4)$ is a 2-cycle. This shows that $gHg^{-1}$ is a strict subset of $H$, and thus this particular $g$ is not an element of $N_G(H)$. We have shown that in order for $g \in N_G(H)$, if and only if $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1}$ equates some form of $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ or $(1, 4, 3, 2)$.

We will now describe a procedure to determine a unique $g$ such that $g(1, 2, 3, 4)g^{-1} = h$ where $h$ is some predetermined form of either $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ or $(1, 4, 3, 2)$. If we want to map $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ to $(3, 2, 1, 4)$, Observe that $1$ maps to $3$, $2$ to $2$, $3$ to $1$, and $4$ to $4$. The element $(1, 3)$ is the element to conjugate by; indeed, we see that $(1, 3)(1, 2, 3, 4)(1, 3)^{-1} = (3, 2, 1, 4)$. Apply this process to each of the four representations of the two elements $(1, 2, 3, 4)$ and $(1, 4, 3, 2)$ to generate all eight solutions. Explicitly writing them out, they are $I, (1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 3)(2, 4), (1, 4, 2, 3), (4, 3, 2, 1), (1, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)(3, 4)$
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.dii}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Observe that $H$ contains five elements; it then follows that $N_G(H)$ contains at most 20 elements because through the mapping $\pi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$ where $x \in H, g \in N_G(H)$, $\pi_g((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))$ can equal each of the four non-identity elements in $H$ and each of these elements have five different ways of being written based off of the starting element. Observe that $\pi_g((1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) \neq I$ because $\pi_g((1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) = I$ implies that $g(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)g^{-1} = I$, $g(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = g$, $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = I$ which is a contradiction. 

Next, observe that $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ is a generating element of $H$ (and in fact every element in $H$ generates $H$), and for any $g \in G$ such that $g(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)g^{-1} = h \in H$, note that $g(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)^kg^{-1} = (g(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)g^{-1})^k = h^k \in H$. Thus, if $\pi_g$ sends $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ to any element in $H$, $\pi_g(H) = H$. We have already identified that there are 20 elements that map $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ to some element in $H$, we define a means to find the unique element that achieves this conjugation.

If we want to map $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ to $(1, 4, 2, 5, 3)$, Observe that $1$ maps to $1$, $2$ to $4$, $3$ to $2$, $4$ to $5$, $5$ to $3$. The element $(2, 4, 5, 3)$ is the element to conjugate by; indeed, we see that $(2, 4, 5, 3)(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)(2, 4, 5, 3)^{-1} = (1, 4, 2, 5, 3)$. Apply this process to each of the twenty possible representations of elements in $H$ to generate the full set.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{4}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We are given that $N$ is a subgroup given it is generated by the elements of the form $x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$. To show that it is normal, assume $z \in N$, and $g \in G$ is some arbitrary element. Then, $gzg^{-1} = gzg^{-1}(z^{-1}z) = (gzg^{-1}z^{-1})z$. Observe that $(gzg^{-1}z^{-1}) \in N$ because if $a, b \in G$ are the inverses of $g, z$ respectively, $(gzg^{-1}z^{-1}) = a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$, which is in $N$ by definition. Thus, $gzg^{-1} = (gzg^{-1}z^{-1})z \in N$ as well given $N$ is closed due to it being a subgroup. This is true for any arbitrary $g \in G$, and thus $N$ is normal.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{5}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Assume that $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic. It then follows that for some $h \in G/Z(G)$, $h$ generates all of $G/Z(G)$. In addition, $hZ(G)$ generates every element in $G$. It then follows that for any element $g$, $g = h^ni$ where $n$ is some natural number and $i \in Z(G)$. Let $g_1, g_2 \in G$ denote two arbitrary numbers. Then, $h_1h_2 = g^{n_1}i_1g^{n_2}i_2$. Given $i_1 \in Z(G)$, $i_1g^{n_2} = g^{n_2}i_1$, and thus $h_1h_2 = g^{n_1}g^{n_2}i_1i_2 = g^{n_1 + n_2}i_1i_2 = g^{n_2}g^{n_1}i_1i_2$. Again, given $i_1, i_2 \in Z(G)$, $g^{n_2}g^{n_1}i_1i_2 = g^{n_2}i_1g^{n_1}i_2 = g^{n_2}i_1i_2g^{n_1} = g^{n_2}i_2i_1g^{n_1} = g^{n_2}i_2g^{n_1}i_1 = h_2h_1$. This proves that $h_1h_2 = h_2h_1$ for any $h_1, h_2 \in G$, and thus $G$ is abelian.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{6}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
It is possible to cleanly split $G$ in half based on whether its in $H$ or if it is not in $H$. Let the set of elements not in $H$ be $H'$.

First, we will show that $hg \in H'$ when $h \in H$, $g \in H'$ (this also works with $h \in H', g \in H$ without loss to generality, merely switch the side $h$ is multiplied in the proof). We know that for any element $x \in G$, $ax = bx$ implies $a = b$. If $g_1, ..., g_{2n}$ are the elements of $G$, $hg_1, hg_2, ..., hg_{2n}$ must all be unique, and given $G$ is closed due to the closure property of groups, $hg_1, hg_2, ..., hg_{2n}$ must contain exactly one copy of every element in $G$. Next, let $g_1, ..., g_n$ be the elements in $H$ and let $g_1', ..., g_n'$ be the elements in $H'$. For the sake of contradiction, if $h \in H$, $g \in H'$ and $hg \in H$, it follows that at least one element in $hg_1', ..., hg_n'$ is an element of $H$ (it is $hg$), and it follows that at least one element in $hg_1, ..., hg_n$ is an element of $H'$. However, this implies that subgroup $H$ is not closed, as there exists a product of two elements in $H$ that is not in $H$. This contradiction shows that $hg \in H'$ when $h \in H$, $g \in H'$.

Next, we will show that $hg \in H$ when $h \in H'$, $g \in H'$. For the sake of contradiction, if $h \in H'$, $g \in H'$ and $hg \in H'$, it follows that at least one element in $hg_1', ..., hg_n'$ is an element of $H'$ (it is $hg$), and it follows that at least one element in $hg_1, ..., hg_n$ is an element of $H$. However, this implies there exists $h \in H'$ and $g_i \in H$ such that $hg_i \in H$, which contradicts the proof we just made. Thus, $hg \in H$ when $h \in H'$, $g \in H'$.

First, observe that for any $h \in H$ and for any $g \in H$, $ghg^{-1} \in H$ due to the closure property of $H$, which is a subgroup. Then, for the sake of contradiction, assume there exists $g \in H'$, $h \in H$, where $ghg^{-1} \notin H$. It directly follows that $ghg^{-1} = h'$ for some $h' \in H'$. Then, $h = gh'g^{-1}$. $(gh')$ is a product of two elements in $H'$, and thus from what we have previously shown, $(gh') \in H$. Then, $(gh')g^{-1}$ is the product between an element of $H'$ and $H$, which we have shown is in $H'$. We thus conclude that $h = (gh')g^{-1} \in H'$. However, this contradicts the fact that $h \in H$. Thus, if $g \in H'$, $h \in H$, then $ghg^{-1} \in H$. This shows that for any $g \in G$ and any $h \in H$, $ghg^{-1} \in G$. This concludes the proof that $H$ is normal.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Consider the group $S_3$, which has 6 elements. Then, observe that the group $H$ consisting of $I, (1, 2)$ is a subgroup of $S_3$ because it is closed, $(1, 2)$ is its own inverse, and the identity is contained. In addition, note that $|S_3|/|H| = 3$. However, note that $H$ is not normal because $(1, 2, 3)(1, 2)(1, 2, 3)^{-1} = (1, 3) \notin H$. This counterexample shows that if $H$ is a subgroup of index three, $H$ is not necessarily normal.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Using the definition of an isomorphism, an automorphism would be any map $\phi : G \rightarrow G$ such that $\phi(hg) = \phi(h)\phi(g)$ where $h, g \in G$. If $\phi$ is the identity map, then it is trivial to show that $\phi(hg) =  hg = \phi(h)\phi(g)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ be two automorphisms. Then, for any $a, b \in G$, 
$$
\phi_1(\phi_2(ab)) = \phi_1(\phi_2(a)\phi_2(b)) = \phi_1(\phi_2(a))\phi_1(\phi_2(b)).
$$
This proves that $\phi_1(\phi_2(x))$ is an automorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.c}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We have already proved that the set of all automorphisms are closed by composition in 8.b. The identity element is the identity automorphism, which exists as noted in 8.a, and it is clear that the composition between any $\phi$ and the identity map is $\phi$. Lastly, to prove the existence of an inverse automorphism to any $\phi$, note that all automorphisms are bijective isomorphisms, and thus by definition there must exist an inverse function $\phi^{-1}$ such that $\phi(\phi^{-1}(x)) = \phi^{-1}(\phi(x)) = x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.d}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
To show that $\phi_g$ is an isomorphism, we merely have to prove that $\phi_g(ab) = \phi_g(a)\phi_g(b)$ for any $a, b \in G$. Let $a, b \in G$ be arbitrary elements. Then, $\phi_g(a)\phi_g(b) = gag^{-1}gbg^{-1} = gabg^{-1} = \phi_g(ab)$. This is true for any $g, a, b \in G$, and thus $\phi_g$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.e}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We need to prove that $\psi(ab) = \psi(a)\psi(b)$ for any $a, b \in G$. Note that
$$
\psi(ab) = \phi_{ab}(x) = abx(ab)^{-1} = abxb^{-1}a^{-1} = a\phi_b(x)a^{-1} = \phi_a(\phi_b(x)) = \psi(a)\psi(b).
$$
This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.f}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
The kernel of $\psi : G \rightarrow Aut(G)$ consists of every element $g \in G$ such that $\psi(g) = I$. This occurs if and only if $\psi_g(x) = gxg^{-1} = x$ for every $x \in G$. This then occurs if and only if $gx = xg$. Thus, the kernel of the map $\psi$ is equal to the center $Z(G) = \{g \in G | gx = xg, \forall x \in G\}$
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.g}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
To show that $Inn(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $Aut(G)$, we must show that $g(Inn(G))g^{-1} = Inn(G)$ for every $g \in Aut(G)$. For any $\phi_h \in Inn(G)$, $g\phi_hg^{-1}(x) = g(hg^{-1}(x)h^{-1}) = g(h)g(g^{-1}(x))g(h^{-1}) = g(h)xg(h^{-1})$. Note that $g(h^{-1}) = g(h)^{-1}$ because $I = g(hh^{-1}) = g(h)g(h^{-1})$. It thus follows that $g\phi_hg^{-1}(x) = g(h)xg(h)^{-1} = \phi_{g(h)} \in Inn(G)$. This is true for any automorphism $g$ of $Aut(G)$, and thus $Inn(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $Aut(G)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.h}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
If $G$ is abelian, then for any $g \in G$, $\phi_g(x) = gxg^{-1} = xgg^{-1} = x$, and thus ever map in the form $\phi_g$ is equivalent to the identity map. Thus, the image of $G$ under $\psi$, $Inn(G)$, is trivial.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{8.i}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
To show that $Aut(Z/3Z) = Out(Z/3Z)$, note that $Z/3Z$ is abelian because it is cyclic, and we have shown in 8.h that $Inn(Z/3Z)$ is trivial. This shows that $Aut(Z/3Z) = Aut(Z/3Z)/Inn(Z/3Z) = Out(Z/3Z)$. Lastly, note that $Aut(Z/3Z)$ is isomorphic to $Z/2Z$ because there are two automorphisms $\phi:$ the identity map and one which maps the two non-identity elements to each other.

Note that $Aut(S_3)$ contains $6$ automorphisms because $S_3$ is generated by $(1, 2, 3)$ and $(1, 2)$, which means $\phi$ is uniquely defined by how these two elements are mapped. There are two ways in which $(1, 2, 3)$ can be mapped, and there are three ways in which $(1, 2)$ can be mapped. In addition, note that $S_3$ has six elements, and the automorphisms formed by $gxg^{-1}$ for each $g \in S_3$ maps $(1, 2, 3)$ and/or $(1, 2)$ to different values. Thus, $|Aut(S_3)| = |Inn(S_3)|$, and thus $Aut(S_3)/Inn(S_3) = Out(S_3) = \{1\}$.

First, given $Z/2Z * Z/2Z$ is clearly abelian, 8.h shows that $Inn(Z/2Z * Z/2Z)$ is trivial, and thus $Aut(K)$ and $Out(K)$ are isomorphic. Next, the Klein 4-group can be interperted as a 2-dimensional vector space over $Z_2$, and each automorphism of the Klein 4-group is an invertible linear transformation from the group to itself. There are three ways to choose the first column so it is non-zero, and two ways to choose the second column so the matrix remains linearly independent. Thus, there are 6 elements in $Aut(K)$, which is the same as $S_3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{9}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\phi$ is a surjective homomorphism from $S_n$ to $Z/pZ$ for an odd prime $p$. It follows from the definition of the homomorphism that for any 2-cycle $c \in S_n$, $I = \phi(I) = \phi(c^2) = \phi(c)\phi(c) = k^2$, where $k$ is some element in $Z/pZ$. However, given $Z/pZ$ is generated by some element $g$, $k = g^n$ for some $n \leq p$. $g^p = I$ by the definition of $Z/pZ$, and $k^2 = g^{2n} = I$ from our homomorphism. It is thus necessarily true that $2n$ is a multiple of $p$. It is not possible for $p = 2n$ as $2n$ is even while $p$ is odd. Thus, the only possibility is that $2p = 2n$, or $p = n$. If this were true, that means $\phi(c) = g^n = g^p = I$ for any two-cycle $c$ in $S_n$. 

Next, note that any element $a \in S_n$, $a$ can be represented as a composition of $2$-cycles. Assume that in cycle notation, $a$ contains the cycle $(a_1, ..., a_n)$. This can be written as the composition of $2$-cycles $(a_1, a_2)(a_2, a_3)...(a_{n - 1}, a_n)(a_n, a_1)$. For any other cycles in $a$, similarly decompose that cycle into $2$-cycles, and in the end, compose all of the sequences of $2$-cycles together to generate a $2$-cycle representation of $a$. Let $b_1b_2...b_k$ be such a representation of $a$ as a composition of 2-cycles. Then,
$$
\phi(a) = \phi(b_1b_2...b_k) = \phi(b_1)\phi(b_2)...\phi(b_k) = I,
$$
given that $\phi$ maps all 2-cycles to the identity. This shows that $\phi$ maps every element in $S_n$ to $I$ in $Z/pZ$. However, this contradicts the fact that $\phi$ is surjective, and this proves that there does not exist a surjective homomorphism from $S_n$ to $Z/pZ$ for any odd prime $p$.
\end{proof}
