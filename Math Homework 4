\begin{problem}{1.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of assumption, assume that $d_A$ is not continuous. This implies that there is at least one $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\lim_{x_0 \rightarrow x} \inf\{|x_0 - y| : y \in A\} \neq \inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\}$. This means that for some $\epsilon > 0$, there exist elements $x_1, x_2, ...$ which get arbitrarily close to $x$ and $|\inf\{|x_i - y| : y \in A\} - \inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} > \epsilon$ for all $i$. This means there exists some $j$ such that $d(x_j, x) < \epsilon/4$. In addition, there must exist some $y_0 \in A$ such that $\inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} \leq |x - y_0| < \inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} + \epsilon/4$. Then, consider the distances from $x_j$ to $x$ and $x$ to $y_0$. Due to the triangle inequality, the distance between $x_j$ and $y_0$ is at most $\inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} + \epsilon/2$. In addition, given $\inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} \leq |x - y_0|$ and $d(x_j, x) < \epsilon/4$, thus the distance between $x_j$ and $y_0$ is also at least $\inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} - \epsilon/4$. However, by definition $|\inf\{|x_j - y| : y \in A\} - \inf\{|x - y| : y \in A\} > \epsilon$, and thus a contradiction is achieved. This contradiction shows that $d_A$ must be continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{1.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
For the sake of assumption, assume $d(K, O^c) = 0$. This implies $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K, y \in O^c\} = 0$. Next, given $K$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we are aware that $K$ must be bounded. Construct a closed $n$-cube that contains the entirety of $K$. Then, partition each side-length of this cube into two equal parts, and form $2^n$ equally sized closed cubes with side-lengths that are half the side-length of the original cube. Then, we will show that there must exist a sub-cube $C$ such that  $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K \cap C, y \in O^c\} = 0$. Given $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K, y \in O^c\} = 0$, there must exist points $x$ in $K$ such that $\inf\{|x - y| : y \in O^c\} < \epsilon$ for any arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$. However, if $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K \cap C', y \in O^c\} > 0$ for every sub-cube $C'$, then it must be true that there exists some $\epsilon_0 > 0$ such that $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K \cap C', y \in O^c\} > \epsilon_0$ for every sub-cube $C'$. This means that there cannot exist point $x_0 \in K$ such that $\inf\{|x_0 - y| : y \in O^c\} < \epsilon_0$, which contradicts the fact that there must exist points $x$ in $K$ such that $\inf\{|x - y| : y \in O^c\} < \epsilon$ for any arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$. Thus, at least one sub-cube $C$ must have the property that $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K \cap C, y \in O^c\} = 0$. Note that $K \cap C$ is compact as well because the intersection of closed sets is closed and it is also clearly bounded. Thus, take the sub-cube $C$ and repeat the process of division and determine a sub-cube $C^*$ such that $\inf\{|x - y| : x \in K \cap C^*, y \in O^c\} = 0$. Repeat this step indefinitely to create an infinite series of nested cubes. Given each interval cube is compact, the nested set theorem (Theorem 2.36 of Rudin) notes that there is at least one element contained within every nested sub-cube. We also know that this point is unique because if there were two distinct points $x, y$ in the intersection of every nested sub-cube, $d(x, y) = \delta > 0$ and it is easy to find a sub-cube which cannot contain two points $\delta$ apart from each other (this is because the side-lengths of the sub-cubes converge at a rate of $O(1/2^n)$). Thus, if $x^*$ is the single point that is contained within every nested sub-cube, it follows that $\inf\{|x^* - y| : y \in O^c \} = 0$. However, given $O$ is open, $K \subset O$ and $x ^*\in K$, it follows that $x^*$ is in a neighborhood of $O$. If this neighborhood has a radius of $\epsilon$, then it is clear that $\inf\{|x^* - y| : y \in O^c \} \geq \epsilon$. This contradicts the fact that $\inf\{|x^* - y| : y \in O^c \} = 0$, and it follows that $d(K, O^c) > 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{1.c}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $\phi$ denote the function such that $\phi(x) = 0$ for $x \in O^c$, $\phi(x) = 1$ for $x \in C$, and $\phi(x) = \frac{d_{O^c}(x) - d_C(x) + 1}{2}$ for any other points. First, note that $C^c$ is open and $(O^c)^c$ is open, thus $C^c \cap (O^c)^c$ is open as well, which means that the set of all points outside $C$ and $O^c$ is open. Next note that for any point in the interior of $C$ or $O^c$, the function is clearly continuous given there exists a neighborhood around that point where the function is a constant. For any point in the interior of $C^c \cap (O^c)^c$, the function is also continuous because there exists a neighborhood around that point where the function is defined as $\frac{d_{O^c}(x) - d_C(x) + 1}{2}$, and this function is clearly continuous given $d_A(x)$ is continuous as shown in 1.a. Lastly, consider the points on $O^c$ and $C$ that are not in the interior. First, without loss to generality let $x$ be a point that is on the boundary of $C$. Then, construct a closed neighborhood $G$ centered at $x$ of radius 1. $G \cap O^c$ is compact, and the result from the previous part shows that there must be a neighborhood of radius $\epsilon$ around $x$ that does not contain $O^c$. Then, to show continuity at $x$, note that any point $x_0$ in the neighborhood of radius $\epsilon$ that is also in $C$ will have $f(x_0) = f(x) = 1$. For any point not in $C$, the function is continuous around $x$ and thus it is clear that the function is continuous at $x$. This shows that $f$ is continuous at any point on the boundary. This completes the proof that $f$ is a continuous function.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
First, we will show that there is a bijection between the set of all countable binary sequences (countable sequences where each element is a 1 or 0) and the set of all real numbers. The base-2 conversion presents a bijection between all real number in $[0, 1)$ and the set of all real numbers in $[0, 1)$ which only contain 1 or 0 as its digits. Then, note there is clearly a bijection between the set of all real numbers in $[0, 1)$ which only contain 1 or 0 as its digits and the set of all countable binary sequences ($0.a_1a_2...$ corresponds to the binary set $\{a_1, a_2, ...\}$). This shows that there is a bijection between all real numbers in  $[0, 1)$ and the set of all countable binary sets. Then, consider the transformation $g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1)$ such that if $x$ is a real number in the form $...a_2a_1.b_1b_2...$, then $g(x) = 0.a_1b_1a_2b_2...$ . First, note that if $x_1 \neq x_2$, there must exist at least one digit that these two numbers do not share, and thus $g(x_1) \neq g(x_2)$. Similarly, if $g(x_1) = g(x_2)$, it is necessarily true that $x_1$ and $x_2$ all the same digits at the same locations, and thus $x_1 = x_2$. This probes that $g$ creates a bijection between the set of all real numbers in $[0, 1)$ and the set of all real numbers. Thus there is a bijection between the set of all countable binary sequences and the set of all real numbers.

Next, we will show that there is a mapping from the set of all countable binary sets to the Cantor set. Let $C_0 = [0, 1]$, and define $C_n$ by taking every disjoint interval in $C_{n - 1}$ and splitting it into two by removing an open set from the middle of that interval with a length equal to 1/3 of the length of the interval itself. It is evident that $C_{\infty}$ is the Cantor set. Let $a_1, a_2, ...$ be a countable sequence of binary values. Let $I_0, I_1, I_2, ...$ be a sequence of intervals in $[0, 1]$ defined as such: Let $I_0 = [0, 1]$, and if $a_k = 0$ then $I_k$ is the left interval that is generated when $I_{k - 1}$ is split into two, and if $a_k = 1$ then $I_k$ is the right interval. Note that $I_k \subset C_k$ and $I_k \subset I_{k - 1}$ for every $k$. Given each interval $I_i$ is closed, the nested interval theorem states that the intersection of $I_0, I_1, I_2, ...$ contains at least one point. This point is clearly a member of the Cantor set given $C_{\infty}$ is the Cantor set. Then, note that if $a_1, a_2, ... \neq a'_1, a'_2, ...$, then the elements in the Cantor set that is generated after undergoing the process is strictly different because if $k$ is the first index where these two series differ, then the intervals $I_k$ and $I'_k$ generated will be disjoint, and thus the intersection of all the intervals will yield strictly different elements in the cantor set. This means that for every countable binary sequence, it is possible to assign one unique value in the Cantor set. This shows that there is a mapping from the set of all countable binary sets onto the Cantor set. Combined with the previous result, regarding bijection between binary series and the real numbers, we conclude that the cardinality of the Cantor set is at least the cardinality of the real numbers. Given the Cantor set is a subset of the real numbers, it is clear that the cardinality of the Cantor set is equal to the cardinality of $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Let $O$ denote an open set. We are aware that any open set in $\mathbb{R}$ is the union of countably many disjoint open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ (Rudin Ch. 2, Problem 29). Let $O'$ denote one open interval in $O$. The length of $O'$ is positive, and thus there exists a value of $n$ where $1/3^n$ is less than the length of the interval. Subdivide the interval $[0, 1]$ into $3^{n+1}$ equidistant segments, each with length $1/3^{n+1}$. Given $O$ has a length of less than $1/3^n$, it must contain at least two of the equidistant segments of length $3^{n+1}$ (if this is not true, it implies that the length of $O$ is less than $1/3^n$). Then, consider partition of $[0, 1]$ into $3^{n+2}$ intervals with lengths $1/3^{n+2}$. $O$ must contain at least six consecutive intervals in this partition. Next, note that in the Cantor set, when $[0, 1]$ is partitioned into $3^k$ equidistant intervals $I_1, I_2, ...$ for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the set does not contain any interval $I_i$ where $i (mod 3)$ is $2$. Of the 6 intervals of length $1/3^{n+2}$ contained in $O'$, at least one set must have an index that is 2 under modulo three, and thus $O'$ and by extension $O$ contains an open interval. This shows that the Cantor set is nowhere dense.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We are aware that the set of all rational numbers is countable. Let $a_1, a_2, ...$ be an enumeration of all the rational numbers in $[0, 1]$. Let $I_n$ denote an open interval centered at $a_n$ and with length $1/3^n$. Note that
$$
m\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i\right) \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} m(I_i) = \frac{1}{2},
$$
with the first equality being true due to countable monotonicity. Then, note that 
$$
m\left([0, 1] - \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i\right) = m\left([0, 1] - \left([0, 1] \cap \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i\right)\right) = m([0, 1]) - m\left([0, 1] \cap \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i\right) 
$$
$$
\leq m([0, 1]) - m\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i\right)  = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2},
$$
with the second equality being true due to the excision property and the inequality being true due to monotonicity. This shows that $[0, 1] - \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i$ is a subset of $[0, 1]$ with positive measure. Then, consider any open set $O$ within the interval $[0, 1]$. Given the set of all rationals is dense in this interval, this open interval must contain at least one rational number $a_k$. There must exist an open neighborhood in $O$ centered at $a_k$. Assume this open interval has a length of $\epsilon$. Then, note that $[0, 1] - \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i$ does not contain any points in the interval with a length of $1/3^k$ centered at $a_k$. Thus, it follows that $O$ contains an open interval of width $\min(1/3^k, \epsilon) > 0$ which is not in $[0, 1] - \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i$. This completes the proof that $[0, 1] - \bigcup_{i = 1}^n I_i$ is nowhere dense.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.c}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
If $B \subset [0, 1]$ is nowhere dense, by definition there must exist an open set in the interval $(0, 1)$. Given every open set is a countable union of open intervals as stated previously, there must exist an open interval in $[0, 1]$, let this interval be $(a, b)$. This implies that $B$ can be covered by the intervals $[0, a]$ and $[b, 1]$. Note that $l([0, a]) + l([b, 1]) = 1 - (b - a) < 1$ By definition, 
$$
m^*(X) = \inf\left\{\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} l(I_n) : X \subset \{I_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \right\}.
$$
Given that $B$ is measurable, it is clear that $m(B) < 1$ given there is a cover of $B$ by intervals such that the sum of the lengths of the interval is less than 1. This is true for any nowhere dense set $B$, and thus there does not exist a nowhere dense set in $[0, 1]$ with a measure of 1.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{4}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Note that in order for $f$ to be measurable, it is sufficient to show that $\{x : f(x) \leq c\}$ is measurable for every $c$. First, note that for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the values of $x$ where $f(x) = n$ is a union of finite, disjoint intervals of length $1/3^n$. This set, $A_n$, is clearly measurable given it is a Borel set. Next, the set of values of $x$ where $f(x) = 0$ is $[1/3, 2/3]$, which is the only region that is not contained in $O_1$. This region is also clearly a Borel set. Thus, given $f$ only takes on non-negative whole numbers, $\{x : f(x) \leq c\} = \{x : f(x) = 0\} \cup ... \cup  \{x : f(x) = floor(c)\}$, and thus $\{x : f(x) \leq c\}$ is always measurable given the union of measurable sets is measurable. Thus, $f$ is measurable.

Then, due to the property regarding countable union of domains,
$$
\int_{[0, 1]} f \ dm = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \int_{C_i} f \ dm = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \int_{C_i} i \ dm.
$$
Note that $m(C_i) = \frac{2^{i}}{3^i{i+1}}$, and thus
$$
\sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \int_{C_i} i \ dm = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} i m(C_i)= \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \sum_{i = j}^{\infty}  m(C_i) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \sum_{i = j}^{\infty}  \frac{2^i}{3^i}.
$$
Using geometric sum, we can calculate that
$$
\frac{1}{3} \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} \sum_{i = j}^{\infty}  \frac{2^i}{3^i} = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{j = 0}^{\infty} (2)\frac{2^j}{3^j} = \frac{2}{3}(3) = 2.
$$
Thus, the integral of $f$ is $2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{5}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
First, note that we are given $f$ and $\phi$ are differentiable, and thus $\int \phi'f \ dm, \int \phi f' \ dm, \int \phi'f' \ dm$ are defined given $\phi'f, \phi f', \phi'f'$ are continuous and continuity implies differentiability.

Then, note that if $F'(x) = f(x)$,
$$
\int_{a}^b \ f(x) \ d\mu = F(b) - F(a).
$$
Thus,
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} (\phi f)' \ dm = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-n}^n )(\phi f)' \ dm = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \phi(n)f(n) - \phi(-n)f(-n) = 0 - 0 = 0,
$$
with the second to last equality being true given $\phi$ has a compact support, which means $\phi(x) = 0$ outside of a bounded interval. Then, due to the product rule and the linearity of the integral, note that
$$
0 = \int_{\mathbb{R}} (\phi f)' \ dm = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi f' + \phi' f \ dm = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi f' \ dm + \int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi' f \ dm.
$$
This thus shows that
$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi f' \ dm = - \int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi' f \ dm
$$
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{6}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Fix $\epsilon > 0$. First, note that due to the Radon measure property of outer regularity, 
$$
\mu(E) = \inf\left\{\mu(O) : E \subset O \right\}
$$
where $O$ can be any open set. This implies that there exists open $O$ such that $\mu(O) - \mu(E) \leq \epsilon/4$ and $E \subset O$. Next, due to the inner regularity property, 
$$
\mu(E) = \sup\left\{\mu(K) : K \subset E \right\}
$$
where $K$ can be any compact set. This implies that there exists compact $K$ such that $\mu(E) - \mu(K) \leq \epsilon/4$ and $K \subset E$. Problem 1.ii shows that $d(K, O^c) > 0$. Let this value be $\delta$. Completely cover $K$ with rectangles with side lengths at most $\delta/\sqrt{2}$. It is clear that there is a finite subcover given $K$ is compact. Also note that every rectangle lies entirely inside $O$ because if a square is not entirely inside $O$, that implies that the square is disjoint from $K$. Thus, if $R_1, R_2, ...$ is the collection of rectangles, then $E - \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i \subset O - \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i \subset O - K$, and thus
$$
\mu\left(E - \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i \right) \leq \mu(O - K) = \mu(O) - \mu(K) = \epsilon/2.
$$
Similarly, $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i - E\subset \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i - K \subset O - K$ and thus
$$
\mu\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i - E \right) \leq \mu(O - K) = \mu(O) - \mu(K) = \epsilon/2.
$$
This shows that 
$$
\mu\left(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i - E \right) + \mu\left(E - \bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} R_i \right) \leq \epsilon.
$$
This is true for any $\epsilon > 0$ and thus the proof is complete.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Given $\phi : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ is a simple function, $U = \{(x, y) : 0 \leq y \leq \phi(x)\}$ is a measurable set. If $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$ are the values that $\phi$ can take and if $A_i = \{x : f(x) = c_i\}$. $A_1, ..., A_n$ are by definition measurable sets, and it is clear that each set in the form $A_i \times [0, c_i]$ is measurable given it is a Borel set. Thus, $U$ is the union of all sets in the form $A_i \times [0, c_i]$, and finite union of measurable sets is measurable and thus $U$ is measurable. 

Next, using the simple approximation function, given $f$ is positive, there exist increasing, non-negative simple functions that converge pointwise to $f$. Let these functions be $\phi_1, \phi_2, ...$ . Let $U_i = \{(x, y) : 0 \leq y \leq \phi_i(x)\}$; it is clear that $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} U_i = U$, and $U$ is measurable due to properties regarding the continuity of measure. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}
