\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Given $|S_4| = 24 = 2^3*3,$ we can see that $2$-Sylow subgroups of $S_4$ have an order of $8$. Observe that the subgroup generated by $(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4)$ and $(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)$ is equal to
$$
\{I, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (2 \ 3)(1 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4), (1 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2), (1 \ 3), (2 \ 4). \}
$$
This subgroup has an order of $8$, and Sylow's theorem shows that all $2$-sylow subgroups of $S_4$ must be isomorphic to this subgroup. Secondly, given that this set is generated by a $2$-cycle $(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4)$ and a $4$-cycle $(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)$ where $(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4)(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4) = (2 \ 3)(1 \ 4)$ is a $2$-cycle, we see that this subgroup is isomorphic to $D_8$. Thus, every $2$-sylow subgroups of $S_4$ are isomorphic to $D_8$.

Given $|S_5| = 120 = 2^3*3*5,$ we can see that $2$-sylow subgroups of $S_5$ have an order of $8$. Observe that the subgroup generated by $(1 \ 2)(3 \ 4)$ and $(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4)$ is equal to
$$
\{I, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (2 \ 3)(1 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4), (1 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2), (1 \ 3), (2 \ 4). \}
$$
This subgroup has an order of $8$, and Sylow's theorem shows that all $2$-sylow subgroups of $S_5$ must be isomorphic to this subgroup. Secondly, we have already shown that this subgroup is isomorphic to $D_8$. Thus, every $2$-sylow subgroups of $S_4$ are isomorphic to $D_8$.

Given $|A_4| = 12 = 2^2*3$, we can see that $2$-sylow subgroups of $A_4$ have an order of $4$. This shows that $2$-sylow subgroups of $A_4$ cannot contain a $3$-cycle due to Lagrange's theorem. There are $8$ $3$-cycles in $A_4$, so the only possible $4$-subgroup of $A_4$ is
$$
\{I, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\}.
$$
This $4$-group has the property that it is generated by any two $2$-cycles in this set, and $a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e$. This shows that the subgroup above is indeed a subgroup, and it is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. Thus, due to Sylow's theorem, all $2$-sylow subgroups of $A_4$ are isomorphic to the Klein four-group.

Given $|A_5| = 12 = 2^2*3*5$, we can see that $2$-sylow subgroups of $A_5$ have an order of $4$. Observe that the subgroup presented above for $A_4$ is also a valid subgroup in $A_5$,
$$
\{I, (1 \ 2)(3 \ 4), (1 \ 3)(2 \ 4), (1 \ 4)(2 \ 3)\}.
$$
This $4$-group has the property that it is generated by any two $2$-cycles in this set, and $a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e$. This shows that the subgroup above is indeed a subgroup, and it is isomorphic to the Klein four-group. Thus, due to Sylow's theorem, all $2$-sylow subgroups of $A_5$ are isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Observe that there are $(p^3 - 1)$ ways to choose the first column such that it is non-zero, $(p^3 - p)$ ways to choose an independent second column, and $(p^3 - p^2)$ ways to choose an independent third column. This shows that $|GL_3(F_p)| = (p^3 - 1)(p^3 - p)(p^3 - p^2) = (p^3)(p^3 - 1)(p^2 - 1)(p - 1)$. It is clear that $p^3 - 1, p^2 - 1, p - 1$ are not divisible by $p$ for any prime $p$, and thus any $p$-Sylow subgroup of $GL_3(F_p)$ must have an order of $p^3$.

Note that the set of matrices in the form 
$$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}  $$
are always invertible for any $a, b, c$, so there are a total of $p^3$ elements in this set. The product of two upper triangular matrices are upper triangular matrices,
$$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} =  \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -a & ac - b \\
0 & 1 & -c \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}, $$
and matrix multiplication is associative. This shows that $H$ is a subgroup of order $p^3$, and Sylow's theorem shows that $H$ is a $p$-Sylow subgroup of $GL_3(F_p)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
$H$ is not normal because
$$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-1 & 0 & 2 
\end{bmatrix} \notin H.$$
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{Problem 2.c/2.d}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We first find the normalizer of $H$. We claim that the normalizer is equal to itself. Note that

$$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c \\
1 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\
z_1 & z_2 & z_3 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
$$
$$
= \begin{bmatrix}
ay_1 + bz_1 + x_1 & -a(ay_1 + bz_2 + x_1 - y_2) + bz_2 + x_2 & (ac-b)(ay_1 + bz_1 + x_1) - c(ay_2 + bz_2 + x_2) + ay_3 + bz_3 + x_3 \\
cz_1 + y_1 & -a(cz_1 + y_1) + cz_2 + y_2 & (ac - b)(cz_1 + y_1) - c(cz_2 + y_2) + cz_3 + y_3 \\
z_1 & z_2 - az_1 & z_1(ac - b) - cz_2 + z_3 
\end{bmatrix}$$

In order for this matrix to be equal to 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
y_1 & y_2 & y_3 \\
z_1 & z_2 & z_3 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
again for any matrix in H (the necessary condition for this matrix being in the normalizer), $cz_1 = 0, az_1 = 0$, $ay_1 = cz_2$, $ay_1 = -bz_1$, which shows that $bz_1 = -cz_2$. From the bottom right, we see that $-z_1b - cz_2 = 0$, which is only possible when $bz_1 = 0$. So unless $z_1 = 0$, $a, b, c = 0$, which means a matrix in $GL_2(F_p)$ is not in the normalizer unless $z_1 = 0.$ Additionally, the bottom right shows that the equality holds only when $cz_2 = 0$, which shows that $z_2$ must also be 0. Top left shows $ay_1 = 0$ similarly, which means $y_1 = 0$. Putting this in and recalculating shows that

$$ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c \\
1 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
0 & y_2 & y_3 \\
0 & 0 & z_3 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & a & b \\
0 & 1 & c \\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}^{-1} 
$$
$$
= \begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & -ax_1 + ay_2 + x_2 & x_1(ac - d) - c(ay_2 + x_2) + ay_3 + bz_3 + x_3 \\
0 & y_2 & -cy_2 + cz_3 + y_3 \\
0 & 0 & z_3 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
We can see that this is equal to 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
0 & y_2 & y_3 \\
0 & 0 & z_3 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
only when $x_1 = y_2$ and $y_2 = z_3$ as a result of the second entry on the first row and the second entry on the third column. Then, the top right entry shows that $x_1 = y_2 = z_3 = 1$. This shows that the normalizer of $H$ is $H$ itself.

Given the normalizer of $H$ is itself, Sylow's theorem shows that $n_p = |GL_3(F_p)|/|N(H)| = (p^3)(p^3 - 1)(p^2 - 1)(p - 1)/(p^3) = (p^3 - 1)(p^2 - 1)(p - 1)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
First, observe that $P \cap H$ must be normal in $H$ because if $g(P \cap H)g^{-1} \notin (P \cap H)$, for any $g \in G$, that implies $g(P \cap H)g^{-1} \in (P \cap H^c)$, which means the group $H$ is not closed (all three elements on the left are elements of $H$). 

Assume $|G| = p^km_1$ and $|H| = p^im_2$, where $m_1, m_2$ are not divisible by $p$. We first know that if $|P \cap H|$ had any factor $q$ other than $p$, Sylow's theorem shows that there must exist a subgroup in $P \cap H$ with order $q^z$. This implies the existence of an element of order $q$ in $P$, which implies $|P|$ is divisible with $q$ due to Lagrange's theorem. This contradiction shows that $|P \cap H| = p^j$, where $j \leq i$ ($j > i$ is impossible due to Lagrange's theorem). 

For the sake of contradiction, assume $j < i$. Given $P \cap H$ is normal in $H$, the quotient group of $H$ by subgroup $P \cap H$ is well-defined, and the order of this quotient group is divisible by $p$. This means that there exists a $p$-sylow subgroup $H'$ in this quotient group of order $p^{i - j}$. Note that $H' \times (P \cap H) = \cup_{h \in H'} h(P \cap H)$ is a subgroup of $H$, and it has order of $p^j$. This must mean it is the $p$-sylow subgroup of $H$. However, this implies that $H' \times P = \cup_{h \in H'} hP$ is a subgroup of order $p^{k + i - j}$ in $G$, which contradicts Lagrange's theorem as $p^{k + i - j}$ is not a factor of $|G|$. This contradiction shows that $j = i$, verifying that $P \cap H$ is indeed a $p$-sylow subgroup of $H$.

For the sake of contradiction, assume there is another $p$-Sylow subgroup $S$ of $H$ other than $P \cap H$. We are aware the left cosets of $H$ in $G$ partition $G$. Thus, $P$ can be represented as the union of $a(P \cap H)$ for exactly $p^{k - i}$ values $a \in G$. However, it would also be true that for these same values $a$, the union of $aS$ would represent a group of order $(p^{i})(p^{k - 1}) = p^k$. This suggests that there are at least two $p$-Sylow subgroups in $G$. However, the third Sylow theorem shows that $n_p = |G|/|N_G(P)|$, and $N_G(P) = G$ given $P$ is normal in $G$. This shows that $n_p = 1$, which contradicts the fact that there are at least two $p$-Sylow subgroups in $G$. This contradiction proves that $P \cap H$ is the unique $p$-Sylow subgroup of $H$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{4}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Note that $|S_n| = n!$, and the highest power of $p$ dividing $n!$ is $\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + ...$

Assume $n < p^2$. This means that $|S_n| = p^km$, where $m$ is not divisible by $p$ and $k = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor < p$. Importantly, note that $pk = p\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor \leq n$Now, consider the subgroup of $S_n$ generated by the disjoint $p$-cycles $c_1 = (1 \ ... \ p), c_2 = (p + 1 \ ... \ 2p), ..., c_k = (p(k - 1) + 1 \ ... \ pk)$. This group has an order of $p^k$ because for each of the $k$ cycles, there are $p$ possible choices for cycle's power. Additionally, this subgroup is clearly abelian as the product of any two cycles $c_1^{n_1} ... c_k^{n_k}$ and $c_1^{m_1}...c_k^{m_k}$ is $c_1^{n_k + m_k} ... c_k^{n_k + m_k}$ no matter what order they are composed in. Sylow's theorem shows that this set must be isomorphic to every other $p$-Sylow subgroup in $S_n$, which means that every $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_n$ is Abelian if $n < p^2$.

On the other hand, assume $n \geq p^2$. This means that 
$$
k = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + ... \geq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + 1.
$$
This means that the group generated by $c_1 = (1 \ ... \ p), c_2 = (p + 1 \ ... \ 2p), ..., c_k = (p(k - 1) + 1 \ ... \ pk)$ does not exist in $S_n$, as $pk > n$. In general, it is impossible to find $k$ disjoint $p$-cycles to make the generating set of the $p$-Sylow subgroup. This means that the minimal generating set for the $p$-Sylow subgroup must contain at least two permutations $a, b$ that overlap with each other, and where neither of the cycles are powers of the other one. We consider two cases. In the first case, the cycle notation of $a, b$, $a_1a_2...a_i$ and $b_1b_2 ... b_j$, have at least one pair of cycles $a_x, b_y$ such that $a_x$ and $b_y$ permute a set of values which are not disjoint from each other but not equivalent to each other (for example, $(1 \ 2), (2 \ 3)$). In this case, the order in which $a, b$ are composed clearly change the resulting composition. This shows the $p$-Sylow subgroup is not Abelian. In the second case, there is at least one pair of cycles $a_x, b_y$ which permute the same values but neither are powers of each other (for example, $(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4), (1 \ 2 \ 4 \ 3)$). For any arbitrary element $v$ permuted by both $a_x, b_y$, here must exist $u$ such that $a_x^u(v) = a_y(v)$. Then, $(a_x^{u} \circ a_y^{-1})(v) = v$, making it a fixed point. The permutation $(a_x^{u} \circ a_y^{-1})$ is clearly in the $p$-sylow subgroup due to closure, and the set of values it permutes is a subset of those permuted by $a_x, b_y$ (because we have shown that it no longer permutes $v$). On the other hand, $(a_x^{u} \circ a_y^{-1}) \neq I$ because $a_x, b_y$ are not powers of each other. Thus, $c = (a_x^{u} \circ a_y^{-1})$ and $a_x$ permute a set of values that are not disjoint but not identical, which we have shown in the previous case yields the fact that the $p$-Sylow subgroup is not Abelian. This concludes the proof that he $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_n$ is not Abelian if $n \geq p^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{5}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Given $|N| = p^km_1$ and $|G| = p^km_2$ where $m_1, m_2$ are not divided by $p$, it follows that any $p$-Sylow subgroup of $N$ are all subgroups of $N$ which have an order of $p^k$. All subgroups of $N$ are also subgroups of $G$, and all subgroups of order $p^k$ in $G$ are $p$-Sylow subgroups of $G$, so it follows that all $p$-Sylow subgroups of $N$ are also $p$-Sylow subgroups of $G$. It remains to be shown that all $p$-Sylow subgroups of $G$ are also $p$-Sylow subgroups of $N$.

For the sake of contradiction, assume there exists $p$-Sylow subgroup $P$ which is not contained entirely in $N$. We are aware $N$ contains at least one $p$-Sylow subgroup of $G$ given $N$ has order $p^km_1$, and let this subgroup be $Q$. The second Sylow Theorem states that any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, meaning $g^{-1}Qg = P$ for some $g \in G$. However, given $N$ is normal, we know $g^{-1}Ng = N$ for any $g \in G$, which means $g^{-1}Qg \subset N$, which contradicts the fact that $g^{-1}Qg = P$ contains at least one element outside of $N$. This contradiction proves that the $p$-Sylow subgroups of $G$ are precisely the $p$-Sylow subgroups of $N$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{6}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
We assume $p \neq q$. If $q \neq 1 (mod \ p)$, Sylow's third theorem shows that $n_p | q$ ($|G|/p^2 = q$) and $n_p = |G|/|N_G(H)| \leq |G|/|p^2| = q$, so either $n_p = 1$ or $n_p = q$. Additionally, $n_p = 1 (mod \ p)$, which means $n_p$ must be $1$ (given $q \neq 1 (mod \ p)$). $1 = n_p = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which means $|N_G(H)| = |G|$, which is only possible when $N_G(H) = G$. This shows the $p$-Sylow subgroup $H$ is normal, meaning $G$ cannot be simple.

If $q = 1 \ (mod \ p)$, it follows that $q > p$ given $q$ cannot be $1$. Sylow's third theorem shows that $n_q | p^2$, meaning $n_q = 1, p, p^2$. $n_q = 1 \ (mod \ q)$, and thus $n_q \neq p$ given $q = 1 \ (mod \ p)$. Lastly, if we assume for the sake of contradiction $n_q = p^2$, we see that $p^2 = 1 \ (mod \ q)$, $(p + 1)(p - 1) = 0 \ (mod \ q)$. This shows $q$ must be divided by $p + 1$ given $p - 1 < q$ and thus $(p - 1)$ cannot be a multiple of $p$. However, given $q$ is prime, it divided by $p + 1$ only when it is equal to $p + 1$. This shows that $q = p + 1$, which only occurs when $p = 2$ and $q = 3$. We thus analyze this case sole: is it possible to have a normal group of order 12? 

In such a group, there are either 4 or 1 $3$-Sylow subgroups. Assume there are $4$ $3$-Sylow subgroups because if there was $1$, Sylow's theorem shows that the $3$-Sylow subgroup is normal. Given all subgroups of order $3$ are cyclic, there must exist $3$-cycles $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ which are unique and also not powers of each other. In other words, in this group of 12, $8$ elements must be $3$-cycles, ($a_i, a_i^2$ for each $i$), and at least one identity. The remaining three elements plus the identity must form the $2$-Sylow subgroup, and given such a $2$-Sylow subgroup must have $4$ elements, the $2$-Sylow subgroup is unique, which then shows that it is normal. Thus, it is impossible to have a normal group of order 12, completing the proof that there are no simple groups of order $p^2q$.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7.a}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
The prime factorization of $336$ is $2^4 * 3 * 7$.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_{7} | 2^4 * 3$ and $n_{7} = 1 \ (mod \ 7)$. This shows that either $n_{7} = 1$ or $n_{7} = 8$. If $n_{7} = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $7$-Sylow subgroup is normal. We assume $n_{7} = 8$. We know $|G|/|N_G(H)| = 336/8 = 42$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7.b}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
The prime factorization of $1176$ is $2^3 * 3 * 7^2$.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_7 | 2^3 * 3$ and $n_7 = 1 \ (mod \ 7)$. This shows that either $n_7 = 1$ or $n_7 = 8$. If $n_7 = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $7$-Sylow subgroup is normal. Assume $n_7 = 8$. Any group $G$ of order 1176 embeds into $S_{8}$ because $G$ acts on the set of $7$-Sylow subgroups by conjugation. The kernel of such mapping must be trivial if we assume $G$ is simple, because there is no non-trivial normal group, and the kernel is always normal. Thus, the mapping to $S_8$ is injective. However, $7^2$ does not divide the order of $S_8$ given it only has one $7$ in its prime factorization, yielding a contradiction on the assumption that $G$ is simple.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7.c}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
The prime factorization of $2907$ is $3^2 * 17 * 19$.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_{19} | 3^2 * 17$ and $n_{19} = 1 \ (mod \ 19)$. This shows that either $n_{19} = 1$ or $n_{19} = 153$. If $n_{19} = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $19$-Sylow subgroup is normal. We assume $n_{19} = 153$. If this is the case, the total number of $19$-cycle elements in the set must be $153(19 - 1) = 2754$ distinct $19$ cycles. There are 153 items remaining.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_{17} | 3^2 * 19$ and $n_{17} = 1 \ (mod \ 17)$. This shows that either $n_{17} = 1$ or $n_{17} = 171$. If $n_{17} = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $17$-Sylow subgroup is normal. We assume $n_{17} = 153$. If this is the case, the total number of $17$-cycle elements in the set must be $171(17 - 1) = 2736$ distinct $17$ cycles. However, given there are $2907$ elements in total, there cannot be the required number of $19$ and $17$ cycles. This contradiction shows that at least one of $n_{17}, n_{19}$ equals $1$, which proves a normal subgroup exists. This proves no group of order $2907$ is simple.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{7.d}
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
The prime factorization of $6545$ is $5 * 7 * 11 * 17$.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_{17} | 5 * 7 * 11$ and $n_{17} = 1 \ (mod \ 17)$. This shows that either $n_{17} = 1$ or $n_{17} = 35$. If $n_{17} = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $17$-Sylow subgroup is normal. We assume $n_{17} = 35$. In this case, given all subgroups of order $17$ are cyclic, there are at least a total of $35(17 - 1) = 560$ $17$-cycles in the group.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_{11} | 5 * 7 * 17$ and $n_{11} = 1 \ (mod \ 11)$. This shows that either $n_{11} = 1$ or $n_{11} = 595$. If $n_{11} = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $11$-Sylow subgroup is normal. We assume $n_{11} = 595$. In this case, given all subgroups of order $11$ are cyclic, there are at least a total of $595(11 - 1) = 5950$ $11$-cycles in the group.

From Sylow's theorem, $n_{7} | 5 * 7 * 17$ and $n_{7} = 1 \ (mod \ 7)$. This shows that either $n_{7} = 1$ or $n_{7} = 85$. If $n_{7} = 1$, $1 = |G|/|N_G(H)|$, which shows that the $7$-Sylow subgroup is normal. We assume $n_{7} = 85$. In this case, given all subgroups of order $7$ are cyclic, there are at least a total of $85(7 - 1) = 510$ $7$-cycles in the group.

Note that $560 + 5950 + 510 = 7020 > 6545$, yielding a contradiction; at least one of $n_{17}, n_{11}, n_7$ must be equal to $1$, which shows that there is a normal subgroup.
\end{proof}
